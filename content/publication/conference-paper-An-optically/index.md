abstract: Two of the key components of sensor motes are a power source and a communications receiver. One approach to creating very small motes is to use free space optical communication and to scavenge power from the optical downlink. In this paper photodiodes are described that were made on a standard CMOS process and generate electrical power from the downlink beam. These photodiodes can be used to power the optical receiver that converts the modulation on the downlink to a bit stream.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Two components of smart dust with optical free space communications have been designed and tested. The first component is photodiode that scavenged power from the downlink. The maximum voltage available from these devices varies from 0.9V to 0.5V as the optical power density changes.
