abstract: As 5G communication network develops, microsensors become more important because they could be the solution of IoE. To realize microsensors, the miniaturization of antenna is a key issue. This paper presents a 26 GHz on-chip triangular monopole antenna with periodical artificial magnetic conductor structures in a standard 65 nm CMOS process. The proposed antenna has a return loss lower than −15 dB from 20 GHz to 27 GHz and a peak gain of −6.04 dBi, making it capable for 26 GHz frequency band of 5G communications.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper proposes a 26 GHz on-chip antenna for microsensor 5G communication.
