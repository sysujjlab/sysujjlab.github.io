abstract: Fluorescent optical fiber temperature sensors require accurate online temperature monitoring in hazardous environments with strong electromagnetic fields, high voltages, flammability, or explosiveness. This imposes stringent requirements on the temperature coefficient stability of the bandgap reference (BGR) circuit. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a high-order curvature compensation bandgap reference (HCC_BGR) circuit fabricated using a 0.18-μm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process. A traditional first-order bandgap reference (TRA_BGR) circuit is also fabricated for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HCC_BGR circuit generates a stable 1.22 V reference voltage with a low-temperature coefficient of 5.56 ppm/°C from −20°C to 85°C. Compared to the TRA_BGR circuit, the HCC_BGR reduces the temperature coefficient by 3.07 times. Furthermore, the low-dropout regulator (LDO) using the proposed HCC_BGR exhibits excellent line sensitivity of 1.52 %/V from 3.4 to 5 V.
