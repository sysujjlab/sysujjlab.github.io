abstract: A network of ultra-low power consumption communications nodes is presented. A base station illuminates small retro-reflecting nodes with a low-divergence beam of light. This powers the node, and also allows information to be transmitted to it. A modulated retro-reflector on the node then returns information to the base station. Design aspects, and results from the implementation are detailed in the paper.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This initial demonstration shows that free-space optical channels offer the ability to minimise path loss and to power low-energy terminals.
