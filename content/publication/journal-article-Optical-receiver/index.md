abstract: The ability to create and direct beams of light means that optical communications potentially offer a large power advantage over RF communications for sensor networks. This paper presents an optically powered receiver front end for wireless optical communications. A complete optical receiver front end including a photodetector, clock and Manchester data recovery circuits has been fabricated using the UMC 180 nm CMOS process. A novel modulation scheme is described that has been devised so that this front end can recover the clock and Manchester data from an optical beam. Experimental results show that the total current consumption of the optical receiver front end is as low as 18.8 nA for a 0.5 V supply when a 1 kbps Manchester data and 8 kHz clock signal are successfully recovered. This means that photodiodes on the same substrate as the front end circuits extract enough power from the communications beam to allow the front end to work at distances of up to 10 m from the transmitter.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
