abstract: The memristor emulator circuit is an economical and effective tool that can simulate various circuit characteristics of the corresponding solid-state memristor. This paper proposes a resistor-free high frequency grounded incremental/decremental memristor emulators (MRE). It consists of a voltage-current conversion (VCC) module, an OTA and a grounded capacitor. The theoretical analysis of the proposed memristor emulator is conducted. The memristor emulator is designed using a standard 180nm CMOS technology. The simulation results show that the proposed memristor emulator demonstrate pinched hysteresis loops for the voltage-current curves with a power supply voltage of Â± 0.9V and prove its memristor characteristics. The proposed design exhibits nonlinearity over a wide input voltage range and performs well at frequencies of up to 50MHz.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
