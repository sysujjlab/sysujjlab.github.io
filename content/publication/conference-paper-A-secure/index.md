abstract: Blockchain, as a type of distributed ledger technology, is well-suited for the distribution, sharing, certification, and tracing of information. Therefore, DApps implemented on blockchain have been utilized in various industries, where businesses utilize DApps to achieve reliable information flow and certification across enterprises or within an enterprise. However, DApps are limited by the constraints of the blockchain architecture, which results in issues such as poor performance, limited scalability, difficult maintenance and management, and high development costs. As a result, it is difficult for DApps to replace traditional database models in enterprises. In order to address this issue, we conducted an analysis of the shortcomings of DApps and proposed a novel blockchain service framework based on ordered Hash tree architecture, which provides a consistent and reliable solution for data management in DApps. Our work, through analysis, is capable of resolving or improving the challenges faced by DApps and holds practical applications value.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This paper introduces a pseudo two-stage pipeline SDPF processor, which enhances the performance of SDPF RISC-V processors by reducing CPI in the serial data path through simulated pipeline structures, which achieves improved performance while maintaining low power and area overheads.
