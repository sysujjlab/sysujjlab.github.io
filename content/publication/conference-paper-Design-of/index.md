abstract: With the rapid development of 5G communication network, microsensors become more and more important because they could be the solution of Internet on Everything. To realize microsensors, the miniaturization of antenna is a key issue. The paper demonstrates a 26 GHz on-chip antenna for microsensors based on standard 0.18 μm CMOS process. Through the introduction of hexagon artificial magnetic conductor structure, the antenna gain is enhanced. The antenna has a peak gain of −7.2 dBi and a good front-to-back ratio. The working frequency band of the antenna spans from 21.67 GHz to 29.99 GHz (32% of center frequency), rendering the antenna capable for 5G communication based on 26 GHz frequency band.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper proposes a design of a 26 GHz on-chip antenna for 5G network microsensors which can be manufactured via a standard 0.18 μm CMOS process.
