abstract:  A single-feed dual-band integrated circuit package antenna (ICPA) is  reported. The ICPA, intended for use in either single-chip or single-package highly integrated concurrent dual-band wireless receivers, is implemented in the format of a cavity-down ceramic ball grid array package of 15 15 1.9 mm3. Results show that the ICPA achieved a frequency ratio of 2.2, return loss bandwidth of 1.67% and gain of -8 dBi at 2.4 GHz, and return loss bandwidth of 0.69% and gain of -2 dBi at 5.25 GHz.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A single-feed ICPA realised on a cavity-down CBGA package of 15 15 1.9mm3 has been proposed for use in highly integrated concurrent dual-band wireless receivers operating at 2.4 and 5.25 GHz. The ICPA offers the possibility to combine antennas and highly integrated wireless receivers into standard surface mounted devices, and thus, enjoy economical advantages of mass production and automatic assembly.
