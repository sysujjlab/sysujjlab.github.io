abstract: This paper presents a subthreshold CMOS voltage reference (VR) that utilizes self-biased circuits. This voltage reference includes temperature compensation circuits to expand its operating temperature range and reduce its temperature coefficient. The proposed CMOS voltage reference is designed using a standard 0.18-μm CMOS process and has a small area of only 0.005 mm^2. Post-layout simulation results demonstrate that the power consumption of the circuit at room temperature (25°C) is only 1.65 nW at a power supply voltage of 1 V. In this case, the voltage reference output is 316.56 mV, with an average temperature coefficient (TC) of 11.14 ppm/°C in a wide temperature range from −40°C to 140°C. Furthermore, the line sensitivity (LS) of the circuit is 0.024 %/V, and the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of the circuit is −86.5 dB at 10 Hz. In summary, the subthreshold CMOS voltage reference structure proposed in this paper demonstrates excellent performance characteristics, such as low power consumption, a small area, and high-temperature stability. These features make it a promising candidate for voltage reference for low-power applications with significant changes in environmental temperature.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:   In this paper, an ultra-low power subthreshold CMOS voltage reference with a self-biased circuit based on SDMT structure with temperature compensation has been proposed.
