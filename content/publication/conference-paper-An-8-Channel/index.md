abstract: This paper presents a single chip integrated 8-channel biomedical signal readout front-end circuit for wearable EEG acquisition system following a low power and high dynamic range (DR) strategy. The proposed 8-channel hybrid sigma-delta analog-to-digital convertor (HSD-ADC) contains a programmable-gain input interface in the first stage to allow the users to optimize their system with different ranges of input level. The time-interleaving technique is used on the second channel-shared stage for low power dissipation. The prototype chip is designed with 65 nm CMOS technology. Post-layout simulation results show a SNDR of 83.7 dB and 98.5 dB dynamic range with S5 Î¼W power dissipation per channel at 1.2 V operation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presented an integrated multi-channel EEG acquisition front-end circuit with embedded PGA, LPF and ADC function.
