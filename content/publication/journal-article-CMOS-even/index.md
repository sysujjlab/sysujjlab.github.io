abstract: DC offset and high flicker noise are the main problems for the direct conversion CMOS mixer design. A novel even harmonic switching mixer implemented in a standard 0.18Âµm  CMOS process for applications in 2.45GHz direct conversion receivers is proposed. The mixer circuit overcomes the problems of DC offset and high flicker noise. It achieves -8.24dB gain, 5.2dB DSB noise figure at 100KHz, 17.25dBm IIP3 and zero DC power consumption.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, an even harmonic mixer and a simple switching mixer are discussed first. And a novel even harmonic switching mixer with DC offset free and low noise figure, especially for the direct conversion application, is proposed.
