abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper proposes a nanowatt voltage reference (VR) with temperature coefficient compensation. All transistors work in the subthreshold region. The complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) voltage and proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) voltage are mainly generated by two NMOS transistors with different threshold voltages. At the same time, a simple temperature compensation circuit is designed to optimize the temperature coefficient at high temperatures, so that the proposed VR circuit can generate a reference voltage with a wider temperature range and a lower temperature coefficient. The proposed VR circuit is implemented using a standard 0.18-μm CMOS process with an active area of only 0.022 mm2. The postlayout simulation results show that the proposed VR circuit generates a reference voltage of 308.21 mV at room temperature. Its temperature coefficient is 6.4 ppm/°C over a temperature range of −40°C°C–140°C, with a power consumption of 7.4 nW. The voltage line sensitivity (LS) is 0.098\%/V, and the power supply ripple rejection (PSRR) is −72 dB @DC and −42 dB @10 MHz.},
