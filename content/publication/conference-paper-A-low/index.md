abstract: This paper proposes a CMOS image sensor that can achieves imaging and energy harvesting simultaneously without introducing additional P-N junctions in the pirel array. The proposed pixel utilizes the vertical N+P-well/DNW/P-sub structures as photodiodes based on a standard 180 nm CMOS mixed-signal process. The N+/P-well is used for imaging, while the P-well/DNW and DNW/P-sub are used for energy harvesting with shorting P-well and P-sub together. Moreover, the traditional 4-T pirel has been improved by using CMOS pairs as the switches and zero-threshold NMOS as the source follower. The rail-to-rail pixel output swing can be achieved. Simulation results show that the dynamic range is increased by 13.4 dB compared with the traditional 4-T pirel. Single pixel occupies an area of 11×13 mm^2 with a fill factor of 72%. An image sensor with 32×32 proposed pixel array and a dual-channel PWM quantizer is designed. Simulation results show that the average power consumption of the image sensor is approximately 6.7 μW@2 MHz.
