abstract: In the field of biomedical sensors, active filters with very low cutoff frequencies are required because of the weak electrical signals from the human body. The Gm-C filters are more prominent among the filter designs, which consist of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) and a capacitor. The key design issues are transconductance and linearity. In this paper, a new ultra-low transconductance OTA structure is proposed. The basic idea is to extend the linear input range of the OTA using the source degeneration pseudo-resistor technique and the bulk-driven technique. The transconductance is reduced by using series-parallel current mirrors for the OTA. This ultra-low transconductance OTA has an extremely low bias current of 0.1nA and a shunt factor of 100, reducing the OTA transconductance to 0.4 ps with 39.55 μVrms noise. It also increases the linear input range from ±50 mV to ±2.5 V, extending it by a factor of 50.
