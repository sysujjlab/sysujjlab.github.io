abstract: This paper presents a high precision bandgap reference using high-order curvature compensation to achieve good temperature coefficients over a wide operating range. The proposed compensation circuit employs currents with optimized temperature coefficients to minimize the temperature drift of the output voltage. The proposed bandgap reference is designed using a standard 0.18 μm CMOS process. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bandgap reference achieved a 1.02 ppm/°C from -40°C to 125°C with a supply voltage of 3.3 V. With the proposed high-order curvature compensation schemes, the bandgap reference circuit can achieve a start-up time of 7 μs and a 85.5 dB PSRR at 100 Hz. The reference voltage is 1.066 V with the precision line sensitivity (LS) of 0.011 %/V for supply voltages between 2 V and 5 V.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
