abstract: This paper proposed an ultra-low power time-domain temperature sensor circuit for IoT applications. It uses 2-T structures to generate reference voltage and complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) voltage. The reference voltage produces reference current by using current mirror to charge the capacitor. Then the voltage of capacitor is compared with the CTAT voltage to generate a temperature-dependent pulse. The pulse width is then digitized to represent the temperature. The temperature sensor is designed using 0.18 μm CMOS process. The simulation results show that it measures temperature from −10°C to 60°C from 1 V supply voltage. The power it costs is 570 nW at a conversion speed of 100 Sa/s.
