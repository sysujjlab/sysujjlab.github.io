abstract: Using optical wireless communications for sensors enables low power and small size of the nodes, such as smart dusts. This paper proposes a passive optical transmitter for smart dusts. Two liquid crystal (LC) modulator circuits have been designed for the switching the liquid crystal cells in the transmitter. The circuits are fabricated using a standard 0.18 Î¼m CMOS process. Measurement results show that they can work under 0.5 V supply and successfully do the switching as designed. The transmission data rate can be 10 bps, which is limited by the response speed of the LC cell.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper discusses a passive optical transmitter for IoT smart dust applications.
