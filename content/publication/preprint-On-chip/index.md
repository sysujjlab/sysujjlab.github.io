abstract: Enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of on-chip solar cells is important for the realization of self-powered smart microsensors. The surface electrode models for the on-chip solar cell based on CMOS process is constructed. It is verified by simulations and measurements that square ring electrode (RE) and center electrode (CE) don’t cause significant differences in the internal resistance of solar cells. Adopting the CEs instead of the REs can significantly reduce the shadowing effect of surface electrodes. To solve the problem of light blockage caused by the metal interconnections in the segmented solar cells, highly doped regions are used to replace some of the metal interconnections. A 0.01mm2 segmented triple-well on-chip solar cells with the CEs and highly doped region as interconnection is fabricated using a standard 0.18 μm CMOS process. Measurement results show a 25.79% photoelectric conversion efficiency under solar simulator illuminations and has a 17.49% improvement compared to the conventional design. Utilizing the proposed solar cells, an on-chip energy harvesting power source has been realized, achieving a maximum conversion efficiency of 10.20% from incident solar power to voltage output power. Despite variations in illumination and load, this power source is able to maintain a relatively stable output voltage of 1 V.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper built theoretical models of square ring electrode and center electrode for the on-chip solar cells first.
