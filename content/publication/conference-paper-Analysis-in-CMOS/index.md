abstract: The LO-RF leakage and feedthrough in double-balanced CMOS Gilbert mixers are analyzed from three aspects in this paper. They are an ideal mixer, a non-ideal mixer with parasitic effects and an ideal mixer with LO mismatch. It is found that the LO phase mismatch and LO amplitude mismatch are both exponentially proportional to the LO feedthrough. If both of them occur at the same time, the amplihlde square of LO leakage is equal to the sum of the amplitude square of each contribution.
