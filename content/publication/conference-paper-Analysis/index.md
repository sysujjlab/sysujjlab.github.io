abstract: The DC offset caused by the LO-RF feedthrough in the mixer of a direct conversion receiver is a serious problem. The LO leakage caused by the LO mismatch in double-balanced CMOS Gilbert mixers is examined and analyzed in four cases, no LO mismatch, LO phase mismatch only, LO amplitude mismatch only and the combination of the two mismatches. The relation between the mismatch and the LO leakage is derived. Simulation results shown are consistent with the analysis. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents the theoretical analysis of LO leakage caused by the LO mismatch in double-balanced CMOS Gilbertmjxers.
